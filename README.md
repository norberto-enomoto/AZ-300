This study guide is open for anyone interested in writing the exam. If you have material you feel worthy of adding to the guide, please submit a PR.

Note: The AZ-300 was recently updated. I have added the new topics to the study guide, but have not added URLs. I already wrote the exam and don't need to go back.
